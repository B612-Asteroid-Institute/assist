    "Here we demonstrate the integration of (84100) Farnocchia, a main belt asteroid,using ASSIST.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ASSIST is a set of python-wrapped C functions that implement an ephemeris quality-integrator that have been compiled into a library.  That library is imported with the assist.py package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary function in assist.py is 'integration_function', which integrates massless test particles in the field of the Sun, planets, Moon, and 16 massive asteroids.  It also includes the J2, J3, and J4 gravitational harmonics of the Earth, the J2 gravitational harmonic of the Sun, and the solar GR terms (using the PPN formulation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The positions of the massive bodies come from two binary files, both from JPL.  The first is for the Sun, planets, and Moon, with the latest DE441 ephemeris. The other is for the asteroids, corresponding to DE441.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinate frame and units are not flexible, currently.  The coordinate frame is the equatorial ICRF, which is the native coordinate system for the JPL binary files.  Note that this is equatorial rather than ecliptic.  In addition, the native coordinates are barycentric, rather than heliocentric. \n",
    "\n",
    "For units we use solar masses, au, and days.  The independent time coordinate is TDB in Julian days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying numerical integrator is IAS15 (Rein & Liu 2015), a 15th order predictor-corrector integrator with an adaptive step-size.  Each time step involves eight sub-steps.  We have modified the integrator to output the state at each of the sub-steps in order to support interpolation of the output."

In fact, for each actual particle production_integration_function_wrapper generates six \"variational particles\" or tangent vectors.  These are vectors with the same dimensionality as an actual particle state, but they are the result of integrating the linearized tangent equations, or variational equations.  There is one variational particle for each of the six dimensions, with the initial state being a unit vector.\n",

We can imagine a vector pointing from one of the particles to the other.  (This is a vector is all six dimensions, both positions and velocities.) \n",

As \"linearized\" suggests, these equations are good to first order in the separation.

The terms in the matrix are independent of the state vector describing the separation of the particles.  \n",
