    "Here we carry out a term-by-term comparison of the components of the various effects that contribute to the acceleration of asteroid (3666) Holman.  This comparison is between the results of ASSIST and those of the JPL small bodies integrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASSIST is a set of python-wrapped C functions that implement an ephemeris quality-integrator that have been compiled into a library.  That library is imported with the assist.py package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary function in assist.py is 'integration_function', which integrates massless test particles in the field of the Sun, planets, Moon, and 16 massive asteroids.  It also includes the J2, J3, and J4 gravitational harmonics of the Earth, the J2 gravitational harmonic of the Sun, and the solar GR terms (using the PPN formulation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The positions of the massive bodies come from two binary files, both from JPL.  The first is for the Sun, planets, and Moon, with the latest DE441 ephemeris. The other is for the asteroids, corresponding to DE441.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinate frame and units are not flexible, currently.  The coordinate frame is the equatorial ICRF, which is the native coordinate system for the JPL binary files.  Note that this is equatorial rather than ecliptic.  In addition, the native coordinates are barycentric, rather than heliocentric. \n",
    "\n",
    "For units we use solar masses, au, and days.  The independent time coordinate is TDB in Julian days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying numerical integrator is IAS15 (Rein & Liu 2015), a 15th order predictor-corrector integrator with an adaptive step-size.  Each time step involves eight sub-steps.  We have modified the integrator to output the state at each of the sub-steps in order to support interpolation of the output."
